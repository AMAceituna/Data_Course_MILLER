Final Project Idea:
Data Analysis of Facebook Page Meme page.

My idea for a data analysis project is to use the Insights data provided by the Meta business suite for the meme page I co-admin.
When users create pages on Facebook, Meta Business Suite is the interface through which the pages are run. Facebook being Facebook,
it compiles a lot of data. I have already found how to export the data (it's in Spanish because my Facebook is in Spanish, but easily 
translated.) Luckily the files from Meta are already .csvs.

There is a lot of data available here. To simplify things, I will just use the data for 2022, which is when the page was already relatively
successful, but quickly growing. The thing I am interested in is comparing how our OC (original content) compares to reshares.
posts. I read somewhere that the shared vs original content ratio on most websites was over 10:1.
Our page has a lot of both OC and reshares, so I'm curious which tend to do better and which have contributed more to our page's growth.
OC is important for page reputation (not being just another "reshare page"), but how important is it quantitatively.
Another dimension of analysis could be comparing the success of the three admins using those two categories. Ie. Maybe my OC is the best, but
my friend David is so good at spotting good content for resharing that he's contributed more to the page's reach overall.
The data I can get from Meta also includes demographics, different types of audience engagement, etc. So this project can be modified/expanded
relatively easily.
